        <h1>A machine learning-powered cryptocurrency trading bot</h1>
        <p>
          The Crypton.trading project was acquired by an investment company that
          continued its further development as a part of their private business
          initiative. Due to that from now on Crypton is closed from public
          access. See the Crypton.trading website layout here.

        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        <p>
          The founders of Crypton approached Evrone with the idea of creating a
          smart trading bot which can determine when best to buy and sell a
          cryptocurrency, so as to maximise returns on investment. Besides a
          great idea, they brought with them a wealth of experience in finance
          and trading, and sought our technical skills to bring it to life.

        <h2>The solution</h2>
        <p>
          At the heart of Crypton is an intelligent trading engine that
          incorporates cutting-edge machine learning and large-scale data
          analysis technologies, enabling it to predict cryptocurrency pricing
          fluctuations and pick the best times to trade. But Crypton is more
          than just a trading engine: our design team worked hard to create not
          only an innovative user experience, but also to craft a bespoke
          identity for the Crypton bot himself. He’s intelligent. He’s
          constantly learning and accumulating experience. He can even tell you
          about himself. He doesn’t stop there, though. He’s also fast, and he’s
          flexible. He’s cost-effective, too.

          Crypton analyses hundreds of data sources using multiple algorithms
          and operates with minimal overheads. Users can ask Crypton to try out
          different trading strategies to find those that best fit their needs.
          And by keeping overheads low, transaction fees are limited to those
          charged by the exchanges themselves.

          Together, these capabilities have culminated in an award-winning
          product, helping our clients to increase value and satisfaction
          amongst their existing customers, and to expand their customer base
          further.

          Crypton is one of the most interesting and innovative projects that
          we’ve had the opportunity to work on, with design and development
          requirements that were absolutely unique.

          "In the crypton identity, we wanted to find a balance between a
          spectacular visual style and the image of a serious financial service.
          The concept of the promotional website is based on the fact that the
          Crypton bot tells about itself using interactive graphs and bubbles
          with text in the first person"
